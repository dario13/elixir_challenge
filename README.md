# Getting Started

> Thank you for taking the time to interview with us today. ðŸš€

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Checkout the project, and then install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElixirProtocol/interview-flask-react.git
cd interview-flask-react
yarn install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the application

In the project directory, launch the frontend with `yarn start`:

```bash
cd interview-flask-react
yarn start
```

The application will be visible at http://localhost:3000

Open up a second terminal or terminal tab and launche the API with `yarn api`:

```bash
cd interview-flask-react
yarn api
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:5000

The objective is to create the signup endpoint in the API and modify the form to manage this endpoint.
